# Distributed Self-Localization for Acoustic Transceiver Networks
## Introduction

In this paper, the computation of $\text{MAE}_{\theta}$ (mean absolute error of node orientations) in Fig. 3(b) and Fig.4(b) is wrong due to the programming errors. 
The corrected version please refer to <Fig3.png> and <Fig4.png> in this file.

Additionally, in Section IV, the sampling frequency is incorrectly described as 1.6 kHz (the correct value is 48 kHz).
